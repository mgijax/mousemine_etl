#
# A simple script to independently verify id integrity in the set of 
# files making up an ItemXML Intermine source.
#
# This means:
#       1. Item ids are unique
#       2. There are no dangling references.
#
# Inputs to the script may comprise any combination of file names and/or directory names;
# directories are expanded to the list of its files (nonrecursive, single level). 
# If no inputs are specified, the script reads from standard input.
# The universe of objects to be checked is defined by the union of the contents of all the inputs.
# 
# If no problems are detected, the script produces no output and exits with a
# status of 0. Otherwise, it prints errors to stdout, and exits with a non-zero status.
#
# NOTE: for a given id, this script reports ONLY THE FIRST occurrence of an error.
#
